## About
An innovative, detailed-oriented, responsible and committed computer engineer, with a get-it-done, on-time and high-quality product spirit, and more than 3 years of experience in user support, defining requirements, designing, implementing, testing and delivering complex back-end and web applications using variety programming languages and technologies. Committed to leading teams in the implementation of advanced systems in order to meet business objectives and to improve structure and efficiency.

I hold a degree in Computer Science from the University of Eldoret, Certificate in Computer Repair and Maintenance from African Institute College, Certificate in Responsive Web Design, Corporate Cybersecurity Management and CompTIA A+.

I believe there is always something to learn, and with digital’s rapid pace, there’s always something new. I enjoy collaborating with others (either in person or virtually) to gain different perspectives to refine strategies. Computer Science is fun in general and I love the idea of problem-solving using programming.

With the excess of information that exist in today’s digital space, the analytical side of my brain is fed by my continuous curiosity, which in turn feeds the right side of my brain, which then drives me to search for (and find) creative solutions to the problems the team faces. There’s rarely a dull moment in my life and I like it that way.
